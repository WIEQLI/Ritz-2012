comp2DDM.m

This script couples a complementarity algorithm and the two dimensional displacement discontinuity method (DDM) to solve boundary value problems for isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic solids containing fractures with user-defined frictional surface properties. Details and sources can be found within the accompanying manuscript Integrating complementarity into the 2D displacement discontinuity boundary element method to model faults and fractures with frictional contact properties, by Elizabeth Ritz, Ovunc Mutlu, and David D. Pollard.

To run, the input spreadsheet and complementarity solver should be in the same folder as comp2DDM.m.

This code was originally composed by Ovunc (Uno) Mutlu and David D. Pollard in 2006, and has most recently been modified by Elizabeth (Libby) Ritz, in 2011.
